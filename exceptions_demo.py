CP1404/CP5632 - Practical
Answer the following questions:
1. When will a ValueError occur?
2. When will a ZeroDivisionError occur?
3. Could you change the code to avoid the possibility of a ZeroDivisionError?

# Question 1:
#   A "ValueError" will occur when a non-integer element is entered as an input
# Question 2:
#   A "ZeroDivisionError" will occur when the denominator is 0
# Question 3:
#   Please see above while loop

#   Smallest number possible: 5
#   Largest number possible: 20

# Question 2:
#   Smallest number possible: 3
#   Largest number possible: 9
#   Line 2 cannot produce a 4, for
#   the sum of an odd number (starting number of 3) and
#   even number (incrementer of 2) always
#   produces an odd number

# Question 3:
#   Smallest number possible: 2.5
#   Largest number possible: 5.5 (depending on rounding)

# Question 4:
import random
random_number = random.randint(0, 100)
